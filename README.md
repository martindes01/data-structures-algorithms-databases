# data-structures-algorithms-databases

## About

These are my revision notes for the Data Structures, Algorithms and Databases module of the MSc Computer Science postgraduate course at the University of Birmingham during the 2020&mdash;2021 session.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to use [pdfTeX](http://tug.org/applications/pdftex/) to generate a PDF file directly from the source.
The pdfTeX extension is included in most [free TeX distributions](http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free).

### Installation

Simply clone the source from this repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/martindes01/data-structures-algorithms-databases.git
cd data-structures-algorithms-databases
```

### Files

- Main LaTeX file: [data-structures-algorithms-databases.tex](data-structures-algorithms-databases.tex)
- Compiled PDF: [data-structures-algorithms-databases.pdf](../../releases/latest/download/data-structures-algorithms-databases.pdf)

## Usage

To generate the PDF, run pdfTeX with the command `pdflatex` to use the standard LaTeX macros.
Two passes are needed to generate all features of the document.

```shell
pdflatex data-structures-algorithms-databases.tex
pdflatex data-structures-algorithms-databases.tex
```
